	<h4>Oceans</h4><br>
	You call me out upon the waters<br>
The great unknown where feet may fail<br>
And there I find You in the mystery<br>
In oceans deep<br>
My faith will stand<br><br>
And I will call upon Your name<br>
And keep my eyes above the waves<br>
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace<br>
For I am Yours and You are mine<br><br>
Your grace abounds in deepest waters<br>
Your sovereign hand<br>
Will be my guide<br>
Where feet may fail and fear surrounds me<br>
You've never failed and You won't start now<br><br>
So I will call upon Your name<br>
And keep my eyes above the waves<br>
When oceans rise, my soul will rest in Your embrace<br>
For I am Yours and You are mine<br><br>
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
Let me walk upon the waters<br>
Wherever You would call me<br>
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander<br>
And my faith will be made stronger<br>
In the presence of my Savior<br><br>
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
Let me walk upon the waters<br>
Wherever You would call me<br>
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander<br>
And my faith will be made stronger<br>
In the presence of my Savior<br><br>
Spirit lead me where my trust is without borders<br>
Let me walk upon the waters<br>
Wherever You would call me<br>
Take me deeper than my feet could ever wander<br>
And my faith will be made stronger<br>
In the presence of my Savior<br><br>
I will call upon Your name<br>
Keep my eyes above the waves<br>
My soul will rest in Your embrace<br>
I am Yours and You are mine<br><br>


<h4>Still</h4><br>
Hide me now<br>
Under your wings<br>
Cover me<br>
Within your mighty hand<br><br>
When the oceans rise and thunders roar<br>
I will soar with you above the storm<br>
Father you are king over the flood<br>
I will be still and know you are God<br>
Find rest my soul<br>
In Christ alone<br>
Know his power<br>
In quietness and trust<br>





<h4>Good Good Father</h4><br>
I've heard a thousand stories of what they think you're like<br>
But I've heard the tender whispers of love in the dead of night<br>
And you tell me that you're pleased<br>
And that I'm never alone<br>
You're a good good father<br>
It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are<br>
And I'm loved by you<br>
It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am<br>
I've seen many searching for answers far and wide<br>
But I know we're all searching<br>
For answers only you provide<br>
'Cause you know just what we need<br>
Before we say a word<br>
You're a good good father<br>
It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are<br>
And I'm loved by you<br>
It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am<br>
Because you are perfect in all of your ways<br>
You are perfect in all of your ways<br>
You are perfect in all of your ways to us<br>
You are perfect in all of your ways<br>
You are perfect in all of your ways<br>
You are perfect in all of your ways to us<br>
Oh, it's love so undeniable<br>
I, I can hardly speak<br>
Peace so unexplainable<br>
I, I can hardly think<br>
As you call me deeper still<br>
As you call me deeper still<br>
As you call me deeper still<br>
Into love, love, love<br>
You're a good good father<br>
It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are<br>
And I'm loved by you<br>
It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am<br>
You're a good good father<br>
It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are<br>
And I'm loved by you<br>
It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am<br>
You're a good good father<br>
It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are<br>
And I'm loved by you<br>
It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am<br>
You're a good good father<br>
You are perfect in all of your ways<br>
It's who you are, it's who you are, it's who you are<br>
And I'm loved by you<br>
You are perfect in all of your ways<br>
It's who I am, it's who I am, it's who I am<br>


<h4>Give Me Faith</h4><br>
I need you to soften my heart<br>
And break me apart<br>
I need you to open my eyes<br>
To see that You're shaping my life<br>
All I am, I surrender
<br>Give me faith to trust what you say
<br>That you're good and your love is great
<br>I'm broken inside, I give you my life
<br>I need you to soften my heart
<br>And break me apart
<br>I need you to pierce through the dark
<br>And cleanse every part of me
<br>All I am, I surrender
<br>Give me faith to trust what you say
<br>That you're good and your love is great
<br>I'm broken inside, I give you my life
<br>'Cause I may be weak
<br>But Your spirit strong in me
<br>My flesh may fail
<br>My God you never will 
<br>I may be weak
<br>But Your spirit strong in me
<br>My flesh may fail
<br>My God you never will
<br>Give me faith to trust what you say
<br>That you're good and your love is great
<br>I'm broken inside, I give you my life
<br>Give me faith to trust what you say
<br>That you're good and your love is great

<br>My God you never will 
<br>I may be weak
<br>But Your spirit strong in me
<br>My flesh may fail
<br>My God you never will
<br>
<br>
<br><h4>So Will I</h4>
<br>God of creation
<br>There at the start
<br>Before the beginning of time
<br>With no point of reference
<br>You spoke to the dark
<br>And fleshed out the wonder of light
<br>And as You speak
<br>A hundred billion galaxies are born
<br>In the vapor of Your breath the planets form
<br>If the stars were made to worship so will I
<br>I can see Your heart in everything You’ve made
<br>Every burning star
<br>A signal fire of grace
<br>If creation sings Your praises so will I
<br>God of Your promise
<br>You don’t speak in vain
<br>No syllable empty or void
<br>For once You have spoken
<br>All nature and science
<br>Follow the sound of Your voice
<br>And as You speak
<br>A hundred billion creatures catch Your breath
<br>Evolving in pursuit of what You said
<br>If it all reveals Your nature so will I
<br>I can see Your heart in everything You say
<br>Every painted sky
<br>A canvas of Your grace
<br>If creation still obeys You so will I
<br>So will I
<br>So will I
<br>If the stars were made to worship so will I
<br>If the mountains bow in reverence so will I
<br>If the oceans roar Your greatness so will I
<br>For if everything exists to lift You high so will I
<br>If the wind goes where You send it so will I
<br>If the rocks cry out in silence so will I
<br>If the sum of all our praises still falls shy
<br>Then we’ll sing again a hundred billion times
<br>God of salvation
<br>You chased down my heart
<br>Through all of my failure and pride
<br>On a hill You created
<br>The light of the world
<br>Abandoned in darkness to die
<br>And as You speak
<br>A hundred billion failures disappear
<br>Where You lost Your life so I could find it here
<br>If You left the grave behind You so will I
<br>I can see Your heart in everything You’ve done
<br>Every part designed in a work of art called love
<br>If You gladly chose surrender so will I
<br>I can see Your heart
<br>Eight billion different ways
<br>Every precious one
<br>A child You died to save
<br>If You gave Your life to love them so will I
<br>Like You would again a hundred billion times
<br>But what measure could amount to Your desire
<br>You’re the One who never leaves the one behind
<br>
<br>
<br><h4>Happy Day</h4>
<br>The greatest day in history
<br>Death is beaten, You have rescued me
<br>Sing it out, Jesus is alive
<br>The empty cross, the empty grave
<br>Life eternal, You have won the day
<br>Shout it out, Jesus is alive
<br>He's alive
<br>Oh, happy day, happy day
<br>You washed my sin away
<br>Oh, happy day, happy day
<br>I'll never be the same
<br>Forever I am changed
<br>When I stand in that place
<br>Free at last, meeting face to face
<br>I am yours, Jesus, You are mine
<br>Endless joy, perfect peace
<br>Earthly pain finally will cease
<br>Celebrate, Jesus is alive
<br>He's alive
<br>And oh, happy day, happy day
<br>You washed my sin away
<br>Oh, happy day, happy day
<br>I'll never be the same
<br>Oh no, forever I am changed
<br>Oh, what a glorious day
<br>What a glorious way
<br>That You have saved me
<br>And oh, what a glorious day
<br>What a glorious name
<br>Hey, and oh, happy day, happy day
<br>You washed my sin away
<br>Oh, happy day, happy day
<br>I'll never be the same
<br>Oh no, forever I am changed
<br>What a glorious, glorious day
<br>I'll never be the same
<br>
